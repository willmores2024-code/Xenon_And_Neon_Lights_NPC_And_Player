Born on the eve of winter holidays — when snowflakes dance in the air and city lights glow with anticipation — this script transforms every vehicle on your server into a moving piece of atmosphere.
Now **both your car and every NPC vehicle** respond to the weather:
* In fog, blizzards, rain, or Christmas-themed weather, they glow with **warm fog-style xenon headlights** and **vivid neon underglow** , just like in cinematic holiday scenes.
* On clear, sunny days — everything stays calm, clean, and realistic.
Three simple modes let you shape the mood:
* **Mode 1** : Always dramatic — glowing fog lights and neon, perfect for action or roleplay servers.
* **Mode 2** : Always classic — smooth, everyday lighting with true-to-life colors.
* **Mode 3** : Smart weather-aware mode — holiday or stormy weather triggers the dramatic look, while fair weather keeps things subtle.
You choose exactly which weather types activate the “magic” — just edit a few lines in the config.
Give your server soul. Give your players the feeling that they’re not just driving down the street — **they’re driving through a story** .
